# TO-DO List

Currently, the program is still somewhat preliminary. Therefore, significant structural changes will likely occur.

## General To-do list
### Missing parts
1. All the main functions need doc.
2. All the examples have been used for binary classification. More general settings (multi-variate classification and regression) should be added.
3. Some test must be carried out in terms of TPU and GPU clustering training. 
4. Transformers and Fast Transformers
5. 
### Refactoring needs 

### Specific To-do list

### Refactor
1. Encoders in encoder.py can be organized. 

### Test
1. Category encoder needs to be tested. 
2. Variable selector must be tested.
3. Cluster based encoding must be tested.
