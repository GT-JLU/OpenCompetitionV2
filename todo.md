# TO-DO List
## General
This is a to-do list for different part of algorithms.

## Util Functions

## Tabular
1. Change naming methods.
2. Discrete methods should handle cases when unique values are too sma self.problem_result_dict
4. Add __repr__ methods for encoder methods. 
5. Variable selector should be rewritten to include discretization process.
6. Pass more arguments to encoders.
